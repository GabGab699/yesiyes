              <h1 class="text-center"><i><strong><bold>THE HISTORY OF MARYKNOLL</bold></strong></i></h1>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h4 class="text-center"><i><b><strong>THE BEGINNING</strong></b></i></h4>
              <p class="lead">It was in the summer of 1960 that Panaboans saw the rise of the first and only Catholic school in the town, Maryknoll College of Panabo Inc.</p>
              <p class="lead">The idea of putting up a Catholic school came upon the prodding of some citizens. Fr. Leo McCarthy M.M, a Maryknoll father and the parish priest then, took the actualization of the matter into his hands with the support of his Congregation and </p>
              <p class="lead">the townspeople. The Maryknoll missionary sisters were invited to run the school as they had been administering Maryknoll College (now Miriam College) in Quezon City. </p>
              <p class="lead">Founded in February 1960 and granted government recognition on August 3, 1964, Maryknoll College was named St. Mary’s High School with Sr. Mary Rhoda as its first principal. Along with Sr. Corde Maria, she launched the school to a remarkable start even with just a plain two-story building. The original structure of the school housed two classrooms provided for the first batch of first-year students, a little office for the principal, a small library, and the Sisters’ Convent on the second floor. </p>
              <p class="lead">On April 3, 1965, Maryknoll College of Panabo was renamed Maryknoll High  School of Panabo, in honor of its founding Maryknoll sisters,  allowed under the provisions of the Corporation Code, Republic  Act 1454. Sr. Corde Maria became the second principal. </p>
              <br>
              <h4 class="text-center"><i><b><strong>1970s</strong></b></i></h4>
              <p class="lead">After a decade of service to the Panabo community, the Maryknoll sisters began to evaluate their apostolate and decided to focus their mission on social work. They saw the capability of the  Filipino laity to continue the educational mission which they had started. In 1971, the management of the school was turned over to a lay administrator.</p>
              <p class="lead">Mr. Pio Galagala was appointed as the first and only lay principal of the school. He continued the Improvement of the school’s facilities considering the enormous increase in the school population during his time. His laid-back but charismatic leadership strengthened the school’s reputation as a leading educational institution in the locality. </p>
              <p class="lead">The school was handed back to a religious order, the  Daughter of the Assumption with Sr. Ma. Aurelia Bardenas, FMA,  as principal in 1978. In her time, an annexed five-classroom building was constructed. A new canteen was also built connecting the main building. The science laboratory was </p>
              <p class="lead">renovated and additional library references were purchased.</p>
              <br>
              <h4 class="text-center"><i><b><strong>1980s</strong></b></i></h4>
              <p class="lead">In 1980 the rein of the school was turned over to the  Dominican sisters of the Most Holy Rosary with Sr. Ma. Virgilia  Rivero, OP, as principal. She initiated the renovation of the old building, library, faculty room, and classrooms. A mini </p>
              <p class="lead">auditorium and faculty dormitory were constructed. Kindergarten classes were opened as an initial step towards the opening of the Elementary Department. The kindergarten program was granted government recognition on June 17, 1985. </p>
              <p class="lead">Sr. Mary Laurencia Camayudo, OP, took charge of the school in 1985.
